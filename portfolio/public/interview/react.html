        <ul>
          <li>stands for object-oriented programming.</li>
          <li>
            A programming model that organizes the software design around data
            and objects rather than the functions and logics
          </li>
          <li>
            focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather
            that the logic required to manipulate
          </li>
          <li>
            Real-world examples of OOP concepts include objects such as a car, a
            person, and a bank account. These objects have properties (e.g. a
            car has a make, model, and color) and methods (e.g. a car can start,
            stop, and drive).
